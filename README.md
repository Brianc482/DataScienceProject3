# DataScienceProject3
The Python source code for this project demonstrates how multiple data sets can be merged into a single data and then using data manipulation, certain values can be extracted from the data within the set. This assignment required using clustering techniques that have been taught during lecture, and I chose to use KNeighbors Classifier and KMeans to train the model and return predictions based on the data points and labels that are choosen.
